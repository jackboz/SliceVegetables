# Slice Vegetables

The 3rd game of my challenge: to make games in a week. I select a successful, presumably simple, game and try to reimplement it as much as I can within a week.

# Controls

LMB. The goal is to get the maximum score with the minimum number of misses.

# Subscribe

Soon I'm going to pick the next game.

Help keep me accountable! Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JackBoz3) or [Itch](https://jackboz.itch.io/).

# Notes

The reference game is [Perfect Slices](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.perfect.slices).

Feel free to educate me. Leave any questions, comments, suggestions, or improvements on the code and the game itself.
